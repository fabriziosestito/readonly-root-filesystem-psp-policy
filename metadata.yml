  io.kubewarden.policy.description: Enforce all the containers to have a readonly root filesystem

  io.kubewarden.policy.usage: |
    The policy inspects the `securityContext` of each container defined inside of
    a Pod and ensures all the containers have the `readOnlyRootFilesystem` attribute
    set to `true`.

    The policy checks the both the `pod.spec.containers` and the init containers
    too.

    Containers that do not have a `securityContext` defined are rejected too.
    That happens because, by default, the root filesystem of a container is
    considered to be writable.

    Ephemeral containers are not checked because, by Kubernetes definition, they
    cannot have a `securityContext`.

    ## Configuration

    The policy doesn't have any configuration.
